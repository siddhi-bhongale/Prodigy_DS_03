Prodigy InfoTech Internship – Task 3: Decision Tree Classifier Modeling
As part of my internship at ProDigy InfoTech, Task 3 focused on applying machine learning techniques to build a predictive model using a real-world dataset. I used the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to construct a decision tree classifier.

Overview
I developed a decision tree model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral attributes such as age, job type, marital status, and previous campaign interactions. This task enhanced my understanding of classification problems and model evaluation techniques.

Skills Gained
Data preprocessing and feature selection with Pandas
Building and training a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn
Visualizing decision boundaries and model structure
Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Interpreting real-world marketing data for business insights
